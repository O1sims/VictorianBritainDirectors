# Corporate Directors of Victorian Britain

This repository provides data and tools for analysing real-world UK directorate data spanning a 20 year period from 1880 to 1900. The data was collected from the Guildhall Library in The City of London and digitised manually.

The raw directorate data are predominately stored in `.csv` and `.xlsx` files, the tools for analysis are written in the `R` programming language and will be extended upon as the data is continually cleaned up.

A specific case of the directorate data of 1880 is accessible in the `networkR` package, which can be found [here](https://github.com/O1sims/networkR) and installed in `R` with the following commands:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("OwenSims/networkR")
```
